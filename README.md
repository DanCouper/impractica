# Possibly Impractical Syntax Display/Highlighting

Instigated by comments from Thomas Phinney [here](http://qr.ae/KFlE0), typeset code display in a non-monospaced serif font. Currently using [Janson Pro Caption via Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/adobe-jenson-pro-caption), hence effectively unusable.

## Initial Notes

- Darker colour seems to be beneficial; among others, Latin Modern (the current 'official' Computer Modern) looks too flimsy on the page. Caption versions definitely seem to perform slightly better.
- Old-style/humanist seems to perform better than transitional. This seems to be due to vertical stress; a slight angle seems to suit. Subtle irregularity seems to be helpful
- Moderns don't really seem to work, ditto slabs. This is likely just personal preference.
- Espinosa Nova looks gorgeous, but has a print licence only. Punchcut Spanish stuff seems to work really well...

Some PDF tests are in `reftests`.
